prompt gesprek voor het generen van de tutorial:

help me improve my prompt by asking some questions and rewriting it afterwards: Lets write a plan/tutorial for creating a todois clone webapp in 5 stages. Lets go from as simple as possible to more complex.  The end stage should be a MPA with vannilla php, tailwind and alpinejs. First define the file structures for the 5 stages and then give the files in each stage. Use empty functions and comments to instead of full code to prevent doing to much. Create this tutorial as a html page with code blocks

Here are some clarifying questions to refine your prompt:

Target Audience: Is this tutorial aimed at beginners, intermediate, or advanced developers?

Functionality Breakdown: What features should each stage introduce (e.g., adding tasks, marking them as complete, persistence with a database, authentication)?

File Structure Evolution: Should each stage show how the file structure expands, or should all files be present from the start but evolve in complexity?

Backend Setup: Should we use a database (MySQL, SQLite) at any stage, or should the first stages use a file-based approach?

Frontend Approach: Should Alpine.js be introduced from the start, or should the first versions use pure HTML/CSS before adding interactivity?

Code Block Format: Do you want inline code snippets or dedicated sections for code?

Styling Depth: Should Tailwind be used lightly or fully utilized from the beginning?

MPA Complexity: Should the final stage include user authentication, routing, or just basic CRUD operations?

Once you answer these, I can refine your prompt into a more detailed, structured request. ðŸš€

this tutorial is aimed at beginners. The end product should include all these features (e.g., adding tasks, marking them as complete, persistence with a database, authentication)? You can decide which of the features belongs to which stage.  Stages should show how the file structure expands. For the database setup the tutorial should use xampp. You can decide when to start using alpinejs. use tailwind from the start. Use dedicated sections for codeblocks. Final stage should include user authentication, routing, and CRUD operations?

Hereâ€™s a refined version of your prompt that ensures clarity and completeness:

Prompt:

Create a beginner-friendly tutorial for building a Todoist clone web app in five stages, progressing from a simple version to a full-featured multi-page application (MPA). The final version should include:

Task management (add, complete, delete)

Database persistence (using XAMPP with MySQL)

User authentication

Routing

Frontend interactivity with Alpine.js

Styling with Tailwind CSS (used from the start)

Structure of the Tutorial
File Structure Evolution

Show how the project structure expands with each stage.

Introduce new files/folders incrementally.

Code Blocks

Use dedicated sections for code.

Provide empty functions and comments instead of full implementations to avoid overwhelming beginners.

Stages Breakdown (You Decide the Feature Progression)
Stage 1: Basic HTML structure with Tailwind for styling, static task list.

Stage 2: Introduce PHP for rendering dynamic tasks (no database yet).

Stage 3: Set up XAMPP & MySQL, store tasks in a database, implement CRUD.

Stage 4: Add Alpine.js for frontend interactivity (task completion without page reload).

Stage 5: Implement user authentication and routing to finalize the MPA.

The tutorial should be written as an HTML page with clear explanations, progressive learning, and code blocks for each section.
